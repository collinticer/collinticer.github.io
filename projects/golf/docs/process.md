# Process Documentation

This document outlines the expected process of various user types through the site.

## Admin User

An admin user will be the one responsible for various admin level functions done on the site including: 

- Add new posts or pages to the blog or site. 
- Deleting users or performing password resets for them.
- Managing comments (if enabled) on site content such as pages and posts.
- Changing the site theme or other visual elements of the site as needed.
- Adding new products or product options to the "grip designer" as needed. 
- Viewing and some means of exporting orders.
- Create an "official" grip design that can be featured to and ordered by customer users. Customers could also change these to their liking before ordering.
- View grip designs created by anyone and possibly save one to be featured in the shop.
- Add a logo or graphic to be used by the grip designer.
- Creating promo codes, coupons, and such.
- Creating categories or themes for designs and assign designs to these. Allows site customers to search designs by category.

## Customer User

A customer user will be the one that visits the site and possibly completing one or many transactions.

A customer will need to be able to do the following:

- Visit the home page.
- Create and manage their account.
- Reset their account password.
- View previous designs they have created.
- View any designs the admin have featured in the store.
- Add designs to their cart.
- View their cart.
- Complete purchase with the products in their cart.
- Go to the grip designer to design their own customized grip.
    - Designs will have a name and description that allow searching for designs later.
- Save a design from the grip designer.
- Add design to cart direct from the grip designer - should save the design automatically too
- Share a design through social media share links - Twitter, Facebook, or via direct product link that can be used anywhere
- View contact information for the store or access a contact form that will relay emails to the admins.
- Add a logo or graphic to be used by the grip designer for their own personal designs. 
- Search grip designs.

## Grip Designer

The grip designer will allow both admin and customers to edit grip designs.

It will need to be able to do the following:

- List various options for a grip design such as color, material, grip texture, etc. allowing users to pick one from each option dropdown.
- Provide a rectangular area where users can "drag and drop" various logos, emoticons, text, etc to in order to alter the design of the grip.
- Provide an area where users can see their saved logos or other uploaded graphics and can upload new graphics.
- Output onto a 2d flat image of what the user might see when product is completed.
- When browser supports it (nearly all should), provide 3d rendering of more accurate final product with logo imposed onto the 3d grip model. 

Additionally the grip designer will be made in such a way that new 3d grip models can be imported and used after project launch. New models will not require a code rework.
